# blockStore
blockStore is an online marketplace for buying and selling digital products only leveraging token-gated access. With blockStore, users can interact with content that is protected by non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. This means that to access a digital product's content, a user must first claim the corresponding NFT. It also provides tools for sellers to list new products for sale leveraging the Orbis SDK. All transactions and access to content on blockStore are recorded on the blockchain, making it easy for users to track their purchases and for sellers to withdraw their profits from their unlock dashboard.
